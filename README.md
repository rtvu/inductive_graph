# InductiveGraph

Inductive graph library implemented in Elixir.

This library is an incomplete port of the [Haskell Functional Graph Library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl) based on [Martin Erwig's Paper](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/InductiveGraphs_JFP01.pdf).

## Development Status

Master branch currently provides functions for construction, destruction, update, conversion, and inspection of inductive graphs.

Other branches in the repository have examples of dfs and bfs implementations and maximum flow.
