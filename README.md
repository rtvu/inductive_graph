# InductiveGraph

Inductive graph library implemented in Elixir.

This library is a port of the [Haskell Functional Graph Library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl) based on [Martin Erwig's Paper](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/InductiveGraphs_JFP01.pdf).

## Development Status

Master branch currently provides functions for construction, destruction, update, conversion, and inspection of inductive graphs.

Other branches in the repository are have samples of dfs and bfs implementations and maximum flow.
